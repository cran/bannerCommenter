Description: A convenience package for use while drafting code.
    It facilitates making stand-out comment lines decorated with
    bands of characters.  The input text strings are converted into
    R comment lines, suitably formatted. These are then displayed in
    a console window and, if possible, automatically transferred to a
    clipboard ready for pasting into an R script.  Designed to save
    time when drafting R scripts that will need to be navigated and
    maintained by other programmers.
